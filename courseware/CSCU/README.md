`Workshop-XX-Guide.docx` generated from it in the course design
([`tools/build-docx.py`](tools/)), with amber placeholder boxes where
screenshots from the CSCU lab go. Decks (.pptx) are still pending.

## Technical Track

[`Technical-Track/`](Technical-Track/) — the hands-on track for technical
staff (recommended order 02 → 03 → 01 → 04 → 05): the Data Identification
deep-dive, the build-your-own dictionary & pattern lab (18 CSCU dictionaries +
7 patterns ship ready-made, generated from the `cscu_core` schema), the
Glossary Generator app module, Similarity & ML inference, and PDC Insights.

## Glossary Generator (Technical Track) notes
